Namenode High Availability is in the HDFS, where namenode has the pair two namenode Active-Standby. Whenever active namenode crashes the 
standby plays a major role, it inptrrupts the process and provide a backup for the active immediately. 
High availability also have a backup plans for standby namenode, so that the cleints would not have to wait. The process will continue without any disturbance 

The NameNodes use shared storage to share the edit log. Edit logs are read by the StandbyNameNode when it takes the responsibility of the ActiveNameNode.
DataNodes must send block reports to both the NameNodes because of the block mappings.
The secondary NameNodeâ€™s role is subsumed by the StandBy NameNode. StandbyNameNode takes periodic checkpoints of the active NameNode.
Checkpointing is done by the StandBy NameNode.
