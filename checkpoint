checkpoint is a special process running after a particular time period in the hdfs. This process adds the new level to hdfs which makes us to 
update the stored file in the hdfs.  
HDFS metadata can be thought of consisting of two parts: the base filesystem table (fsimage) and the edit log which 
lists changes made to the base table (edits). Checkpointing is a process of reconciling fsimage with edits to produce
a new version of fsimage. There are two benefits arising out of this: a more recent version of fsimage, and a truncated edit log.
